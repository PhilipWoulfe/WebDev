            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>The importance of typography in design is often overlooked by those outside the industry. After all it’s just words, isn’t it? Why so
            important? Typography is there for a reason. At its most basic it is there simply to be read. Further than that, and in a much wider
            sense it is there to communicate.</p>
            
            <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>Probably the most basic thing about type is that is has to be read, so therefore it must be visually distinct from its background.
            This can be done in a number of ways dependent upon the type of background used. On plain backgrounds, complex or extravagant type may
            be used. Details such as Drop Shadows can be used to add depth. On complex backgrounds plain and simple tones work well to define the
            type.</p>
            
            <blockquote>“Good typography depends on the visual contrast between one font and another and the contrast between text blocks and the
            surrounding empty space. Nothing attracts the eye and brain of the viewer like strong contrast and distinctive patterns, and you only
            get those attributes by carefully designing them into your pages” </blockquote>
            
            <p>Much has been written about the psychology of how the brain interprets the written word, the importance of Contrast and Placement, of
            Leading and Tracking, but the thing that helps to understand the importance of typography is to place a single letter onto an image. Move
            it around, try to find the best position within the composition, play with its opacity. Notice its interaction with the background image
            Learn to understand, it is visual communication. A single letter is at once subtle and complex; it has meaning within and without context.
            It is a graphical symbol, a digital representation. Typography, like other aspects of Design, is about the bigger picture, it’s about what
            its saying. The medium is the message.</p>
            <p>Typography is the art of arranging type into a legible, aesthetically pleasing and design-appropriate layout. In print this is set in
            stone; the reader can't change the way the text appears once it's been printed. On the web, however, users can adapt their browser
            settings to increase or decrease the default font size, overwrite font-size choices the designer has made, or change colours to increase
            contrast. Consequently, you might think that effective typography isn't possible on the web. But not only is it possible; in many ways
            the web offers superior options to traditional typography. Not because as a designer you have finer control over how type is arranged or
            positioned, but because the web allows users to control the appearance of type to suit their own particular needs.</p>

            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p>It used to be that if you wanted to render type on the web so that it appeared in the same font across different computers, you had to
            stick to a paltry handful of fonts common to all browsers and computers. This strictly limited palette of fonts led to a depressing
            homogenization of typography on the web, depriving web designers from the joys (or horrors) of a full set of fonts to choose from.
            Thankfully this has all changed! For the first time, a wide range of fonts is available for use on the web, and web design is evolving
            to take full advantage. </p>
            
            <p>Here are just a few points regarding the use of fonts in web design:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bolded">Less is more:</span> Choose one base font, and one display font, and try to stick to that. Just because
                    there are thousands of fonts available, it doesn't mean you have to use them all in your design</li>
                    <li><span class="bolded">Stick to fonts designed for purpose:</span> There's no point using a display font for your paragraph copy
                    as display fonts have been designed to be used in small bursts: they're ideal as headlines, but not optimized for reading large
                    passages.</li>
                    <li><span class="bolded">Choose appropriate fonts:</span> Make sure you choose fonts that are appropriate for your subject matter.
                    A script font might work well to represent a hand-written letter, but it's not going to give a professional impression if you're
                    using it on a corporate website.</li>
                    <li><span class="bolded">Mind the gaps:</span> The space around the words is equally important to the words themselves. Restraint
                    in the number of competing elements will clarify the message, allowing the reader to fully engage. This is not to say avoid
                    decorative elements or graphics but to make sure there is clarity and distinction in words and images.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="col" id="col2">
            <h1>Leading, Tracking and Kerning</h1>
            <p>A good piece of typography should melt away, being almost imperceptible as it facilitates easy reading, showcasing the content. In
            print there are many ways to control type, and the way individual lines, words and characters interact with each other. These options
            include the ability to set the leading (the space between lines), tracking (the uniform space between letters across a passage of text)
            and kerning (the spacing between two specific characters).</p>
            
            <p>All typographical properties are best set in relative units such as ems to allow for scenarios where text is resized by the reader.
            On the web, there are similar controls for both tracking and leading, but kerning isn't directly controllable using CSS. To set your
            leading, use the CSS property line-height. To control tracking, use letter-spacing. You can also control the space between words using
            the word-spacing property, allowing you to open up your text without increasing the tracking to an uncomfortable degree.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to kern between individual characters, the only practical way to do so is to wrap the affected characters in their own
            &lt;span&gt; tags. You can then apply CSS properties to the span, controlling the kerning. This can become a big job very quickly, so use
            sparingly! All the same best-practice rules apply to spacing on the web as in print, so it's well worth reading up on how to choose an
            effective level of leading, tracking etc. Consider using a grid to help you align the baselines of your type into a clear structure to
            aid both legibility and improve design coherence. </p>
            
            <h3>Column Width</h3>
            <p>The width of a text column can strongly impact on its readability. In print, columns are typically set to contain anything between 45
            and 75 characters (which are approximately 9 to 15 words wide). This is considered to be the ideal width for text, allowing the reader
            to easily move between lines without losing their place. The same general rules apply on the web, so aim to set your type in columns no
            more than around 80 characters wide. Just as in print, on the web you can set your type using either ragged line endings, or justified.
            Use the text-align property, and choose either left for ragged right, right for ragged left, or justify for fully justified text without
            the ragged line endings. New to CSS3 is the text-justify property, which allows fine control over how justified text is spaced to fill the
            line. Unfortunately, browser support is still very sketchy at present.</p>
            
            <h3>Typographic alignment</h3>
            <p>Just as in print, on the web you can set your type using either ragged line endings, or justified. Use the text-align property, and
            choose either left for ragged right, right for ragged left, or justify for fully justified text without the ragged line endings. New to
            CSS3 is the text-justify property, which allows fine control over how justified text is spaced to fill the line. Unfortunately, browser
            support is still very sketchy at present.</p>
            
            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>The Web allows the use of other media besides type and graphics; Video and animation for example. With animation typography can show
            actual physical ‘movement’ instead of just suggested ‘movement’. Communication is still the name of the game, but what is been
            communicated works on many differing levels.</p>

                <p>This website is an example of bad typography. The text sizes, styles and fonts are changed constantly leaving an unorganised
                structure to the information. It is hard to read through as the content consistency causes the user to unable to keep track of
                what they’re reading or lose their place.<br><br>
                
                The overuse of headers and the changing of font size make everything lose all sense of importance and feels like everything is
                incoherently screaming at you.</p>
            </div>

                <a href="http://www.sihs.bie.edu/index.htm"><img class="image" src="images/badTyp2.png"></a>
                <p>This website uses far too many different fonts (at least 6 types). The consistency of the design and layout are considerably
                bad but the choice in altering the font type in every new line of text was a poor one. The designer didn’t know which font they
                liked best so they decided to use all of them.<br><br>
                
                The ever changing font is continued on other pages of the website with the same result. Is gives the impression that everything
                is lost and unprofessional; Not something you want in a website.</p>

                <p>This websites typography uses bold font to draw the users eye to key words which corresponds with the brand values
                and qualities.  <br><br>
                
                The text is so pronounced that when the image background changes, the font can still clearly be read which
                makes this particular use of text successful and professionally layed out.
                <br><br>
                
                In my opinion Land Rover have paid a lot of attention to detail in there typography design and execution.</p>

                <a href="http://www.beoplay.com/products/h6-rapha-edition#in-the-zone"><img class="image" src="images/typography2.png"></a>
                <p>This websites typography uses clean white font with a minimal black background design making the text the focal point
                of the website.
                <br><br>
                
                 The users eye is drawn to the site typography and in this case, the site sells its product with clever use of text.
                 <br><br>  
                
                 The use of coloured secondary font on key words in the typography make a statement to the user. The use of this secondary
                 coloured text is continued thoughout the site on keywords which draws to users eye to important content and because of this,
                 I feel this websites typography is very successful.
