            <h1>Importance of Visual Continuity and Consistency</h1>
            <p>A key component of ensuring web and software interfaces create a positive impact is to provide visual continuity
            in their design.Good visual design will enhance the communication of an idea and further the reputation of a
            company, product, or service. When users 'discover easily' and 'do quickly' with the help of well executed graphical
            elements that are placed in a cohesive visual context,their loyalty to a product, service, or company increases.
            Visual continuity, the unseen skeletal structure that functionality and content is presented within, acts as a kind
            of <q>visual grammar.</q></p>
            
            <p>Delivering visual consistency in websites and software applications improves usability and functionality. It's no
            use to anyone if you have a great option that's next to impossible to find. Users want your website and software to
            be the answer to their needs. It's up to developers to ensure their site and software is a joy to use...

            in your site."</blockquote>

            <h1>Elements of Good Design</h1>
            <h3>Strive for Simplicity</h3>
            <p>Keeping it simple should be the primary goal of site design. Users are rarely on a site to enjoy the design; furthermore,
            in most cases they are looking for the information despite the design. Strive for simplicity instead of complexity.</p>
            
            <h3>Colour Continuity</h3>
            <p>Colour continuity sends a signal to users that you are disciplined about detail. Your colour choice sends a clear message
            about the kind of company you are. Limiting your brand colours will reduce visual confusion and help put the user at ease.</p>
            
            <h3>Editorial Style</h3>
            <p>Establishing a clear editorial style across all mediums is important. Users will feel more confident about your company
            if they feel you speak with one consistent voice.</p>

                <p>In this image, the mouse is clicking on the first link in the sidebar each time.<br><br>
                
                This website is bad because as you click on links in the side bar, the other links change
                position and appear and disappear at random. Each coloured arrow indicates a specific link;
                you can track the movement of the links by following the arrows.<br><br>
                
                This makes it hard to navigate the site, you don’t know how to get back to the last
                page or if there are pages you haven’t seen since you can’t view them in order.</p>

                <p>In this image the website layout is consistent.<br><br>
                
                The links remain the same after you click on them, the topics expand and collapse and you can
                easily return to a topic you previously visited. You can also work through the links systematically
                so you know you have seen everything.</p>
