                        You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        Walk right in it's around the back<br>
                        Just a half a mile from the railroad track<br>
                        You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        <br>
                        Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on<br>
                        Thanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the<br>
                        restaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the<br>
                        church nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and<br>
                        Fasha the dog. And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of<br>
                        room downstairs where the pews used to be in. Havin' all that room,<br>
                        seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't<br>
                        have to take out their garbage for a long time.<br>
                        <br>
                        We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be<br>
                        a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So<br>
                        we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW<br>
                        microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed<br>
                        on toward the city dump.<br>
                        <br>
                        Well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the<br>
                        dump saying, "Closed on Thanksgiving." And we had never heard of a dump<br>
                        closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off<br>
                        into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.<br>
                        <br>
                        We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the<br>
                        side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the<br>
                        cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile<br>
                        is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we<br>
                        decided to throw our's down.<br>
                        <br>
                        That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving<br>
                        dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the<br>
                        next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie. He said, "Kid,<br>
                        we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of<br>
                        garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it." And<br>
                        I said, "Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope<br>
                        under that garbage."<br>
                        <br>
                        After speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we<br>
                        finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down<br>
                        and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the<br>
                        police officer's station. So we got in the red VW microbus with the<br>
                        shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the<br>
                        police officer's station.<br>
                        <br>
                        Now friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at<br>
                        the police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for<br>
                        being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and<br>
                        we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out<br>
                        and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again,<br>
                        which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station<br>
                        there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was<br>
                        both immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said "Obie, I don't think I<br>
                        can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on." He said, "Shut up, kid.<br>
                        Get in the back of the patrol car."<br>
                        <br>
                        And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the<br>
                        quote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of<br>
                        Stockbridge, Massachusets, where this happened here, they got three stop<br>
                        signs, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the<br>
                        Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars,<br>
                        being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to<br>
                        get in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of<br>
                        cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer's station.<br>
                        They was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and<br>
                        they took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles<br>
                        and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each<br>
                        one was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach,<br>
                        the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to<br>
                        mention the aerial photography.<br>
                        <br>
                        After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put<br>
                        us in the cell. Said, "Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your<br>
                        wallet and your belt." And I said, "Obie, I can understand you wanting my<br>
                        wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you<br>
                        want my belt for?" And he said, "Kid, we don't want any hangings." I<br>
                        said, "Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering?"<br>
                        Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the<br>
                        toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took<br>
                        out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - roll the<br>
                        toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie<br>
                        was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice<br>
                        (remember Alice? It's a song about Alice), Alice came by and with a few<br>
                        nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back<br>
                        to the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat,<br>
                        and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.<br>
                        <br>
                        We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten<br>
                        colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back<br>
                        of each one, sat down. Man came in said, "All rise." We all stood up,<br>
                        and Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy<br>
                        pictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he<br>
                        sat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the<br>
                        twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows<br>
                        and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog.<br>
                        And then at twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles<br>
                        and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry,<br>
                        'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American<br>
                        blind justice, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the<br>
                        judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy<br>
                        pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each<br>
                        one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. And<br>
                        we was fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but thats not<br>
                        what I came to tell you about.<br>
                        <br>
                        Came to talk about the draft.<br>
                        <br>
                        They got a building down New York City, it's called Whitehall Street,<br>
                        where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected,<br>
                        neglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one<br>
                        day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so<br>
                        I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. `Cause I wanted to<br>
                        look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted<br>
                        to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York,<br>
                        and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all<br>
                        kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave<br>
                        me a piece of paper, said, "Kid, see the phsychiatrist, room 604."<br>
                        <br>
                        And I went up there, I said, "Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I<br>
                        wanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and<br>
                        guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, Kill,<br>
                        KILL, KILL." And I started jumpin up and down yelling, "KILL, KILL," and<br>
                        he started jumpin up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down<br>
                        yelling, "KILL, KILL." And the sargent came over, pinned a medal on me,<br>
                        sent me down the hall, said, "You're our boy."<br>
                        <br>
                        Didn't feel too good about it.<br>
                        <br>
                        Proceeded on down the hall gettin more injections, inspections,<br>
                        detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they was doin' to me<br>
                        at the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four<br>
                        hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty<br>
                        ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was<br>
                        inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no<br>
                        part untouched. Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the<br>
                        last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there,<br>
                        and I walked up and said, "What do you want?" He said, "Kid, we only got<br>
                        one question. Have you ever been arrested?"<br>
                        <br>
                        And I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice's Restaurant Massacre,<br>
                        with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all<br>
                        the phenome... - and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, did you ever<br>
                        go to court?"<br>
                        <br>
                        And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten<br>
                        colour glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on<br>
                        the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, I want<br>
                        you to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W .... NOW kid!!"<br>
                        <br>
                        And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W's<br>
                        where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after<br>
                        committing your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly<br>
                        looking people on the bench there. Mother rapers. Father stabbers. Father<br>
                        rapers! Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me! And<br>
                        they was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the<br>
                        bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest<br>
                        father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly<br>
                        'n' nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me<br>
                        and said, "Kid, whad'ya get?" I said, "I didn't get nothing, I had to pay<br>
                        $50 and pick up the garbage." He said, "What were you arrested for, kid?"<br>
                        And I said, "Littering." And they all moved away from me on the bench<br>
                        there, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I<br>
                        said, "And creating a nuisance." And they all came back, shook my hand,<br>
                        and we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing,<br>
                        father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the<br>
                        bench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of<br>
                        things, until the Sargeant came over, had some paper in his hand, held it<br>
                        up and said.<br>
                        <br>
                        "Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-<br>
                        know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-<br>
                        you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-<br>
                        officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say", and talked for<br>
                        forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had<br>
                        fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there,<br>
                        and I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it<br>
                        down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the<br>
                        pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the<br>
                        other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on<br>
                        the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the<br>
                        following words:<br>
                        <br>
                        ("KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?")<br>
                        <br>
                        I went over to the sargent, said, "Sargeant, you got a lot a damn gall to<br>
                        ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm<br>
                        sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin here on the Group W bench<br>
                        'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women,<br>
                        kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug." He looked at me and<br>
                        said, "Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints<br>
                        off to Washington."<br>
                        <br>
                        And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a<br>
                        study in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I'm<br>
                        singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar<br>
                        situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a<br>
                        situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into<br>
                        the shrink wherever you are ,just walk in say "Shrink, You can get<br>
                        anything you want, at Alice's restaurant.". And walk out. You know, if<br>
                        one person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and<br>
                        they won't take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony,<br>
                        they may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them.<br>
                        And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in<br>
                        singin a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an<br>
                        organization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said<br>
                        fifty people a day walking in singin a bar of Alice's Restaurant and<br>
                        walking out. And friends they may thinks it's a movement.<br>
                        <br>
                        And that's what it is , the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacre Movement, and<br>
                        all you got to do to join is sing it the next time it come's around on the<br>
                        guitar.<br>
                        <br>
                        With feeling. So we'll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and<br>
                        sing it when it does. Here it comes.<br>
                        <br>
                        You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        Walk right in it's around the back<br>
                        Just a half a mile from the railroad track<br>
                        You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        <br>
                        That was horrible. If you want to end war and stuff you got to sing loud.<br>
                        I've been singing this song now for twenty five minutes. I could sing it<br>
                        for another twenty five minutes. I'm not proud... or tired.<br>
                        <br>
                        So we'll wait till it comes around again, and this time with four part<br>
                        harmony and feeling.<br>
                        <br>
                        We're just waitin' for it to come around is what we're doing.<br>
                        <br>
                        All right now.<br>
                        <br>
                        You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        Excepting Alice<br>
                        You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant<br>
                        Walk right in it's around the back<br>

                        <br>

                        At Alice's Restaurant<br><br>
