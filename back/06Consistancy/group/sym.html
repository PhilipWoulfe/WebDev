            <h1>Symmetry</h1>
            <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/09/04/perfectly-paired-using-symmetry-in-web-design/">Carrie Cousins from <em>tympanus.net</em> says:</a>
            <blockquote>Symmetrical design relies on principles of balance, rhythm, proportion and unity to create a style with mirroring sides...But symmetrical design is not always identical design.</blockquote>
            <p>Symmetry is the mirroring of a shape or image used to create a sense of balance. It occurs around a point or axis.
            There are many forms of symmetry.</p>
            
            <h3>Horizontal symmetry</h3>
            <p>This is usually the easiest to identify, if the left and right sides of the image or shape are a reflection of each other,
            the shape is symmetrical. The human body is one example of this, although it is not as symmetrical as it appears. We think of
            our faces as symmetrical, however when show an image of either the left or right half our face mirrored, the result can be
            surprisingly different from our actual faces.</p>
            
            <h3>Vertical symmetry</h3>
            <p>This is similar to horizontal symmetry but with a horizontal axis instead of a vertical axis. This doesn't occur often in nature.</p>
            
            <h3>Radial symmetry</h3>
            <p>This is symmetry on multiple axis, for example a honeycomb or a starfish. It has fallen out of favour in web design since the
            1990s. However it is still used in logo and print design.</p>
            
            <h3>Colour symmetry</h3>
            <p>Symmetry is usually used to refer to shape, however the colour wheel also has symmetry to it. The opposing colours on the wheel
            complement each other and can be used to create a sense of balance and harmony.</p>
            
            <h3>Asymmetry</h3>
            <p>Symmetrical design isn't always the best choice. Asymmetry can be used to create more interesting and visually appealing designs.
            It can be used to attract attention to specific areas of a picture or web page.</p>

            <h1>Balance</h1>
            <a>Jason Beaird from <em>The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</em> says:</a>
            <blockquote>Another tendency for non-designers working on layouts is to center-align everything on a page...[the] reason is a desire for balance.</blockquote>
            
            <p>As with an old fashioned weighing scale, if the two sides of the scales have the same weight, they can be said to be balanced.
            Balance can be divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical balance.</p>
            
            <h3>Symmetrical Balance</h3>
            <p>If the two sides of the scales have the same weight and the same size and shape, they have symmetrical balance. An example of this
            in web design would be a website which mirrors its design on a vertical axis.</p>
            
            <h3>Asymmetrical Balance</h3>
            <p>If the two sides of the scales have the same weight but different size and shape, the have asymmetrical balance. If a website is
            going to have an asymmetrical design, it is important that it is a balanced design.</p>
            
            <h1>Scale</h1>
            
            <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/size-scale-proportion/">Steven Bradley  from <em>vanseodesign.com</em> says:</a>
            <blockquote>
                <ul>
                    <li>Size: the physical dimensions of an object</li>
                    <li>Scale: the relative size of different objects or of an object to a common standard</li>
                    <li>Proportion: harmony of scale</li>
                </ul>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Scale is important in web design, if all the text is the same size, it is difficult to know where to start reading and what
            is important. Scale lets us divide the page into sections and differentiate between them.</p>
            
            <h1>Proportion</h1>
            <p>An object out of proportion with the rest of the design can draw the eye to it. This can be used effectively to draw
            attention to a specific part of the web page.</p>

                <p>This website is an example of how symmetry can be done badly.<br><br>
                
                Blinkee.com has many things wrong with it, but its choice in placing all the information onto the left 2/3rds of the page
                is troubling. As it is trying to sell a large number of items, condensing all the information into such a small space makes it
                feel that everything is cluttered and messy with no balance.<br><br>
                
                The fact that everything is blinking also can give the user a headache when simply making use of the space available would solve
                some of its numerous problems. There would be extra space to make the content more available and make everything flow better.</p>

                <p>This website is a disaster. The constant change in text size, font choice/colour, image size and overall placement is seemingly
                unorganised and random.<br><br>
                
               As you scroll down, you can see columns don’t have a consistent width. Even the elements inside the columns don’t have any placement
               pattern.  The scale is completely off and it gives a cluttered feeling as the videos and images are different sizes.<br><br>
               
               Everything seems thrown into a pile and left to sort itself out.</p>

                <p>In this image the website is built using Horizontal Symmetry.<br><br>
                
                The use of Horizontal Symmetry in a website provides the user with a balanced and comfortable platform to navigate through.
                <br><br>
                
                In this example, the perfect symmetry and proportion of this web design provides the user with
                a feeling of harmony and clarity when navigating the site. The use of Horizontal Symmetry draws the users eye to links and text
                positioned along the grid axis points make the content of the site clean,organised and easy to read.</p>

                <p>In this image the website is built using Bilateral Symmetry.<br><br>
                
                 Bilateral symmetry is mainly used to group certain elements, enabling website visitors to
                 locate similar elements to ensure a delightful user experience. Bilateral symmetry uses more
                 than one axis to balance a composition.<br><br>  
                
                In this example, the use of white space in the background draws the users eye to the cetre
                axis, where the designer can be creative but still have a perfectly balanced and symmetrical
                layout.</p>
