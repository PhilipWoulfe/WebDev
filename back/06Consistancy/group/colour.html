            <h1>Colour Theory</h1>
            <h3>The Colour Wheel</h3>
            <p>A colour circle is made up of 3 colours; Red, yellow and blue. In 1666, Sir Isaac Newton created the first diagram of primary colours.
            Artists and scientists have designed and studied variations of Newton’s concept. Over the years, there have been disputes over different
            ways to express the colour wheel but in reality, any logical wheel that shows an arranged sequence can be valid.</p>
            <p>In colour theory, the traditional primary colours cannot be formed or mixed by any combination of other colours. All other colours are
            derived from these three hues. Secondary colours are green, orange and purple. They are formed by mixing the primary colours together.
            Tertiary colours are made by mixings the primary and secondary colours together.</p>
            
            <h3>Color Harmony</h3>
            <p>Colour harmony is described as a colour arrangement that is pleasing to the eye. It can create a feeling of balance and order to the
            viewer. Something that is not harmonious can be seen as messy or hectic.</p>
            <p>On one side a wrong choice of colour can be seen as so overdone
            or chaotic it can be hard to look at. On the other side the colours can be son bland that the user is not taking in any of the
            information presented. The visual requirement is to create of structure that makes sense so that the user can stay engaged in the
            content, but not tired out from the bombardment of visuals.</p>
            
            <h3>Colour Context</h3>
            <p>The behaviour of shapes and colours in relation to each other is a difficult area. When comparing certain colours inside each other,
            the contrasting effects can appear sharper, duller, or another colour altogether. Look at this example.</p>
            <img src="images/coloureg.gif">
            <p>You should see that the small purple rectangle on the left has a red-purple shade when compared to the rectangle on the right. As
            you can see from the image below, they are in fact the same colour.</p>
            <img src="images/coloureg2.gif">
            <p>Watching the way colours can impact each other is the beginning of colour relativity. The saturations and values of different hues
            can make visible changes in our perceptions of colour.</p>

            <h1>Colour in Websites</h1>
            <p>When talking about the design of a new website, a common question is – “What colours do I use?”. Picking the right colour pallet for
            your site is vital when it comes to product branding and effectively conveying your idea or message to users. How the colours are viewed
            can be different in other cultures but colours can mean more than people think at first. Many things could (and should) effect you
            selection process such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Target audience</li>
                    <li>Product/service provided</li>
                    <li>Website objective</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For example, white is a popular, clean colour but it symbolises death in China. Young people are drawn towards saturated colours when
            compared with adults who find the brash. The following list is of the potential meaning of colours:
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="color:red">Red</span>: Passion, romance, aggression</li>
                    <li><span style="color:orange">Orange</span>: Excitement, warmth, pessimism </li>
                    <li><span style="color:#D5C700">Yellow</span>: Brightness, illumination, cowardice</li>
                    <li><span style="color:green">Green</span>: Nature, growth, envy</li>
                    <li><span style="color:blue">Blue</span>: Security, loyalty, sadness</li>
                    <li><span style="color:purple">Purple</span>: Creativity, royalty, idealistic</li>
                    <li><span style="color:black">Black</span>: Power, sophistication, evil</li>
                    <li><span style="color:grey">White</span>: Pure, clear, empty</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Saturation</h3>
            <p>Saturation is an important factor when talking about website colour. If your site uses product pictures or headlines with important
            messages, you should pick a desaturated colour as a background in order to make it stand out more. A saturated background will take up
            the page making the content lost. The pictures will lose their effectiveness, your words will be hard to read and the site hard to
            navigate. The colours of the product pictures and main headlines should always be more saturated than their respective backgrounds
            as the will likely draw the user’s eye first.</p>
            <h3>Too Much Colour</h3>
            <p>Colour harmony is the most important item to account for when picking a colour for your website. Picking a small number of colours,
            four or five, plus black and white, should be more than plenty. Too many colours disorientate, distract and annoy the user from why they
            came to you website in the first place </p>

                <p>The colour blue is used to cultivate trust, a clear majority of people prefer the colour blue. It conveys a sense of trust,
                loyalty and peace. <br><br>

                This company is entrusted with the personal details and intimate knowledge of over a billion people so this is an excellent colour to use.<br><br>

                The use of green as a call to action as well as use of the isolation effect makes the sign up button stand out well.</p>

                <p>The colour black is seen to represent sophistication, elegance, authority, power, sleekness and luxury.<br><br>

                These are all impressions that Lamborghini would like to convey as they are a manufacturer of high end, luxury super-cars.<br><br>
                
                The sole use of gold in the logo helps it to stand out against the black and grey tones of which the rest of the site is composed.<br><br>
                
                The use of red as a call to action draws the eye to the find out section of the website.

                <p>In this image the website is built using Horizontal Symmetry.<br><br>
                
                The use of Horizontal Symmetry in a website provides the user with a balanced and comfortable platform to navigate through.
                <br><br>
                
                In this example, the perfect symmetry and proportion of this web design provides the user with
                a feeling of harmony and clarity when navigating the site. The use of Horizontal Symmetry draws the users eye to links and text
                positioned along the grid axis points make the content of the site clean,organised and easy to read.</p>

                <p>In this image the website is built using Bilateral Symmetry.<br><br>
                
                 Bilateral symmetry is mainly used to group certain elements, enabling website visitors to
                 locate similar elements to ensure a delightful user experience. Bilateral symmetry uses more
                 than one axis to balance a composition.<br><br>  
                
                In this example, the use of white space in the background draws the users eye to the cetre
                axis, where the designer can be creative but still have a perfectly balanced and symmetrical
                layout.</p>
